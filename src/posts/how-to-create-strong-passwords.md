# How to Create Strong, Memorable Passwords

Creating a strong password doesn't mean it has to be impossible to remember. In fact, the best passwords are often the ones that tell a story only you know.

## The Problem with Traditional Advice

We've all been told to use:
- At least 8 characters
- A mix of uppercase and lowercase
- Numbers and symbols
- Random characters

While this creates mathematically strong passwords, it often leads to passwords like `Tr0ub4dor&3` which are actually easy for computers to guess but hard for humans to remember.

## A Better Way: Passphrases

A passphrase is a sequence of words that are random to a computer but meaningful to you.

Example: `correct-horse-battery-staple`

This method, popularized by XKCD, creates passwords that are:
1. Much longer (length is the most important factor for security)
2. Easier to type
3. Easier to remember

## Using passwrd.in

Our **Memorable Password** generator uses this exact principle. It combines words from categories you choose (like Food + Travel) and adds "hacker" substitutions if you want extra complexity.
