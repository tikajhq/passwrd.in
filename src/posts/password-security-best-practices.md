# Password Security Best Practices

In 2024, password security is more important than ever. Here are the top tips to keep your accounts safe.

## 1. Use a Password Manager

You can't remember unique, strong passwords for every site. Use a password manager like Bitwarden, 1Password, or the built-in managers in Chrome/Apple.

## 2. Enable 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)

Even the strongest password can be stolen. 2FA adds a second layer of defense. Use an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Authy) instead of SMS whenever possible.

## 3. Never Reuse Passwords

This is the #1 rule. If one site gets hacked, attackers will try that email/password combination on every other major site.

## 4. Use Unique Emails (Advanced)

If possible, use email aliases (like `user+facebook@gmail.com` or Apple's "Hide My Email") to track who is selling your data and prevent cross-site tracking.

## 5. Check for Breaches

Regularly check [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com) to see if your email or password has appeared in a data breach.

## How passwrd.in Helps

Our **Domain Password** generator is designed to solve the "unique password" problem without a password manager. By using a master key + the website name, you can generate a unique, strong password for every site that you can re-generate anytime, anywhere.
